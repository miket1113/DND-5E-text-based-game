# DnD-5E-text-based-game


A text based DnD game made in RUBY

This project will be in work for a VERY long time. It will mainly start out as vanilla DnD and may move into home brew

Expect this program to be buggy. I am a novice to the ruby language and am using this to teach myself more, if you encounter bug please tell me and I will attempt to handle them :)
